# InstaPro
InstaPro is a React-based web application that allows users to browse Instagram-like profiles. It fetches data from API and displays it in an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started
To run InstaPro, you need to follow these simple steps:

Clone or download the project repository.

Navigate to the project root directory in your command prompt or terminal.

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

### npm install
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the following command:

### npm start
This will open up the application in your default web browser.

## How It Works
The main functionality of InstaPro is to allow users to search for Instagram-like profiles and posts based on their usernames. Once the data is retrieved, InstaPro displays it in a visually appealing manner that is easy to navigate and understand.

The application also provides links to the actual pages for each profile and post, allowing users to view them in the website.

Moreover, it showcases how React can be leveraged to build slick, modern web applications that fetch and display data from third-party APIs in real-time.
